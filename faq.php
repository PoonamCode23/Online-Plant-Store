                        <p>This is generally an indication of poor watering habits. The best way to water your online plant is to thoroughly flush it until water runs freely out the drainage holes. Shallow watering can cause browning of tips.</p>

                        <p>Make sure your succulents from an online nursery get enough light. Water according to the season and most importantly avoid overwatering as succulents are hardy plants. Water the soil directly without letting water stagnate on succulents. Use a potting mix with good drainage meaning so that water is not retained in the soil for long.</p>

                    <p>Nutrient deficiency can be a major reason for the nonflowering of plants. Below are some basic tips you need to follow to encourage flowering while deciding to buy plant online:</p>
<p>1. Use rich soil. Soil that is light and rich in compost or manure provides plenty of nutrients constantly to the plants.</p>
<p>2. Remove the old faded or dried out flowers as they consume the energy requirement for new flowers</p>
<p>3. Fertilize the plants with a good organic fertilizer like cow manure every 14 days</p>
<p>4. Do mulching every month and provide proper watering</p>
